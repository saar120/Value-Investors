## Project Summary

This project was a real breaking point in my development journey, I have learnd to work with new technologies such as firebase (firestore and auth),
Styled components and MUI to make builidng basic and complex components easier.
I have also learned and used context api for better state manangemt and avoid props and state drilling.
I am sure this project will help me to improve and continue to write better code.
